# LightGCNxGPT

This project aims to explore the integration of GCNs and GPT in Movie
Recommendation Systems, focusing on the synergy between two advanced
paradigms that can overcome the limitations of existing approaches. By delving into
the capabilities of GCNs to model graph-based dependencies and GPT's prowess in
contextual understanding, the research endeavours to present a more comprehensive
and contextually aware recommendation system. It sets the platform for a novel
approach that maximises the strengths of both GCNs and GPT.

In summary, the objective and contribution of the work presented is to showcase the
improved performance of the LightGCNxGPT model against the current state-of-the-
art recommender systems. LightGCNxGPT is the pioneering work that uses LLMs to
refine the recommendations of its base model.
